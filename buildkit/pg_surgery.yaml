           [8]F.34.1. Functions

           The pg_surgery module provides various functions to perform surgery on
           a damaged relation. These functions are unsafe by design and using them
           may corrupt (or further corrupt) your database. For example, these
           functions can easily be used to make a table inconsistent with its own
           indexes, to cause UNIQUE or FOREIGN KEY constraint violations, or even
           to make tuples visible which, when read, will cause a database server
           crash. They should be used with great caution and only as a last
           resort.

        F.34.1. Functions [10]#

           heap_force_kill(regclass, tid[]) returns void
                  heap_force_kill marks "used" line pointers as "dead" without
                  examining the tuples. The intended use of this function is to
                  forcibly remove tuples that are not otherwise accessible. For
                  example:

        test=> select * from t1 where ctid = '(0, 1)';
        ERROR:  could not access status of transaction 4007513275
        DETAIL:  Could not open file "pg_xact/0EED": No such file or directory.

        test=# select heap_force_kill('t1'::regclass, ARRAY['(0, 1)']::tid[]);
         heap_force_kill
        -----------------

        (1 row)

        test=# select * from t1 where ctid = '(0, 1)';
        (0 rows)


           heap_force_freeze(regclass, tid[]) returns void
                  heap_force_freeze marks tuples as frozen without examining the
                  tuple data. The intended use of this function is to make
                  accessible tuples which are inaccessible due to corrupted
                  visibility information, or which prevent the table from being
                  successfully vacuumed due to corrupted visibility information.
                  For example:

        test=> vacuum t1;
        ERROR:  found xmin 507 from before relfrozenxid 515
        CONTEXT:  while scanning block 0 of relation "public.t1"

        test=# select ctid from t1 where xmin = 507;
         ctid
        -------
         (0,3)
        (1 row)

        test=# select heap_force_freeze('t1'::regclass, ARRAY['(0, 3)']::tid[]);
         heap_force_freeze
        -------------------

        (1 row)

        test=# select ctid from t1 where xmin = 2;
         ctid
        -------
         (0,3)
        (1 row)
