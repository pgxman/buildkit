  F.1. adminpack
  
     adminpack provides a number of support functions which pgAdmin and
     other administration and management tools can use to provide additional
     functionality, such as remote management of server log files. Use of
     all these functions is only allowed to the superuser by default but may
     be allowed to other users by using the GRANT command.
  
     The functions shown in Table F.1 provide write access to files on
     the machine hosting the server. (See also the functions in
     Table 9.99, which provide read-only access.) Only files within the
     database cluster directory can be accessed, unless the user is a
     superuser or given privileges of one of the pg_read_server_files or
     pg_write_server_files roles, as appropriate for the function, but
     either a relative or absolute path is allowable.
  
     Table F.1. adminpack Functions
  
     Function
  
     Description
  
     pg_catalog.pg_file_write ( filename text, data text, append boolean )
     -> bigint
  
     Writes, or appends to, a text file.
  
     pg_catalog.pg_file_sync ( filename text ) -> void
  
     Flushes a file or directory to disk.
  
     pg_catalog.pg_file_rename ( oldname text, newname text [, archivename
     text ] ) -> boolean
  
     Renames a file.
  
     pg_catalog.pg_file_unlink ( filename text ) -> boolean
  
     Removes a file.
  
     pg_catalog.pg_logdir_ls () -> setof record
  
     Lists the log files in the log_directory directory.
  
     pg_file_write writes the specified data into the file named by
     filename. If append is false, the file must not already exist. If
     append is true, the file can already exist, and will be appended to if
     so. Returns the number of bytes written.
  
     pg_file_sync fsyncs the specified file or directory named by filename.
     An error is thrown on failure (e.g., the specified file is not
     present). Note that data_sync_retry has no effect on this function,
     and therefore a PANIC-level error will not be raised even on failure to
     flush database files.
  
     pg_file_rename renames a file. If archivename is omitted or NULL, it
     simply renames oldname to newname (which must not already exist). If
     archivename is provided, it first renames newname to archivename (which
     must not already exist), and then renames oldname to newname. In event
     of failure of the second rename step, it will try to rename archivename
     back to newname before reporting the error. Returns true on success,
     false if the source file(s) are not present or not writable; other
     cases throw errors.
  
     pg_file_unlink removes the specified file. Returns true on success,
     false if the specified file is not present or the unlink() call fails;
     other cases throw errors.
  
     pg_logdir_ls returns the start timestamps and path names of all the log
     files in the log_directory directory. The log_filename
     parameter must have its default setting
     (postgresql-%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S.log) to use this function.
