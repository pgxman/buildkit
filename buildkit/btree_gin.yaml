     F.8.1. Example Usage
     F.8.2. Authors
  
     btree_gin provides sample GIN operator classes that implement B-tree
     equivalent behavior for the data types int2, int4, int8, float4,
     float8, timestamp with time zone, timestamp without time zone, time
     with time zone, time without time zone, date, interval, oid, money,
     "char", varchar, text, bytea, bit, varbit, macaddr, macaddr8, inet,
     cidr, uuid, name, bool, bpchar, and all enum types.
  
     In general, these operator classes will not outperform the equivalent
     standard B-tree index methods, and they lack one major feature of the
     standard B-tree code: the ability to enforce uniqueness. However, they
     are useful for GIN testing and as a base for developing other GIN
     operator classes. Also, for queries that test both a GIN-indexable
     column and a B-tree-indexable column, it might be more efficient to
     create a multicolumn GIN index that uses one of these operator classes
     than to create two separate indexes that would have to be combined via
     bitmap ANDing.
  
     This module is considered "trusted", that is, it can be installed by
     non-superusers who have CREATE privilege on the current database.
  
  F.8.1. Example Usage
  
  CREATE TABLE test (a int4);
  -- create index
  CREATE INDEX testidx ON test USING GIN (a);
  -- query
  SELECT * FROM test WHERE a < 10;
