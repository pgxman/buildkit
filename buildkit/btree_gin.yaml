        F.8. btree_gin -- GIN operator classes with B-tree behavior [7]#

           [8]F.8.1. Example Usage
           [9]F.8.2. Authors

           btree_gin provides GIN operator classes that implement B-tree
           equivalent behavior for the data types int2, int4, int8, float4,
           float8, timestamp with time zone, timestamp without time zone, time
           with time zone, time without time zone, date, interval, oid, money,
           "char", varchar, text, bytea, bit, varbit, macaddr, macaddr8, inet,
           cidr, uuid, name, bool, bpchar, and all enum types.

           In general, these operator classes will not outperform the equivalent
           standard B-tree index methods, and they lack one major feature of the
           standard B-tree code: the ability to enforce uniqueness. However, they
           are useful for GIN testing and as a base for developing other GIN
           operator classes. Also, for queries that test both a GIN-indexable
           column and a B-tree-indexable column, it might be more efficient to
           create a multicolumn GIN index that uses one of these operator classes
           than to create two separate indexes that would have to be combined via
           bitmap ANDing.

           This module is considered "trusted", that is, it can be installed by
           non-superusers who have CREATE privilege on the current database.

        F.8.1. Example Usage [10]#

        CREATE TABLE test (a int4);
        -- create index
        CREATE INDEX testidx ON test USING GIN (a);
        -- query
        SELECT * FROM test WHERE a < 10;
