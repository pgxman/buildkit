  F.47. tsm_system_time
  
     F.47.1. Examples
  
     The tsm_system_time module provides the table sampling method
     SYSTEM_TIME, which can be used in the TABLESAMPLE clause of a SELECT
     command.
  
     This table sampling method accepts a single floating-point argument
     that is the maximum number of milliseconds to spend reading the table.
     This gives you direct control over how long the query takes, at the
     price that the size of the sample becomes hard to predict. The
     resulting sample will contain as many rows as could be read in the
     specified time, unless the whole table has been read first.
  
     Like the built-in SYSTEM sampling method, SYSTEM_TIME performs
     block-level sampling, so that the sample is not completely random but
     may be subject to clustering effects, especially if only a small number
     of rows are selected.
  
     SYSTEM_TIME does not support the REPEATABLE clause.
  
     This module is considered "trusted", that is, it can be installed by
     non-superusers who have CREATE privilege on the current database.
  
  F.47.1. Examples
  
     Here is an example of selecting a sample of a table with SYSTEM_TIME.
     First install the extension:
  CREATE EXTENSION tsm_system_time;
  
     Then you can use it in a SELECT command, for instance:
  SELECT * FROM my_table TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM_TIME(1000);
  
     This command will return as large a sample of my_table as it can read
     in 1 second (1000 milliseconds). Of course, if the whole table can be
     read in under 1 second, all its rows will be returned.
