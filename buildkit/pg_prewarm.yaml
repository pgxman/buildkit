     The pg_prewarm module provides a convenient way to load relation data
     into either the operating system buffer cache or the PostgreSQL buffer
     cache. Prewarming can be performed manually using the pg_prewarm
     function, or can be performed automatically by including pg_prewarm in
     shared_preload_libraries. In the latter case, the system will run a
     background worker which periodically records the contents of shared
     buffers in a file called autoprewarm.blocks and will, using 2
     background workers, reload those same blocks after a restart.
  
  F.30.1. Functions
  
  pg_prewarm(regclass, mode text default 'buffer', fork text default 'main',
             first_block int8 default null,
             last_block int8 default null) RETURNS int8
  
     The first argument is the relation to be prewarmed. The second argument
     is the prewarming method to be used, as further discussed below; the
     third is the relation fork to be prewarmed, usually main. The fourth
     argument is the first block number to prewarm (NULL is accepted as a
     synonym for zero). The fifth argument is the last block number to
     prewarm (NULL means prewarm through the last block in the relation).
     The return value is the number of blocks prewarmed.
  
     There are three available prewarming methods. prefetch issues
     asynchronous prefetch requests to the operating system, if this is
     supported, or throws an error otherwise. read reads the requested range
     of blocks; unlike prefetch, this is synchronous and supported on all
     platforms and builds, but may be slower. buffer reads the requested
     range of blocks into the database buffer cache.
  
     Note that with any of these methods, attempting to prewarm more blocks
     than can be cached -- by the OS when using prefetch or read, or by
     PostgreSQL when using buffer -- will likely result in lower-numbered
     blocks being evicted as higher numbered blocks are read in. Prewarmed
     data also enjoys no special protection from cache evictions, so it is
     possible that other system activity may evict the newly prewarmed
     blocks shortly after they are read; conversely, prewarming may also
     evict other data from cache. For these reasons, prewarming is typically
     most useful at startup, when caches are largely empty.
  autoprewarm_start_worker() RETURNS void
  
     Launch the main autoprewarm worker. This will normally happen
     automatically, but is useful if automatic prewarm was not configured at
     server startup time and you wish to start up the worker at a later
     time.
  autoprewarm_dump_now() RETURNS int8
  
     Update autoprewarm.blocks immediately. This may be useful if the
     autoprewarm worker is not running but you anticipate running it after
     the next restart. The return value is the number of records written to
     autoprewarm.blocks.
  
  F.30.2. Configuration Parameters
  
     pg_prewarm.autoprewarm (boolean)
            Controls whether the server should run the autoprewarm worker.
            This is on by default. This parameter can only be set at server
            start.
  
     pg_prewarm.autoprewarm_interval (integer)
            This is the interval between updates to autoprewarm.blocks. The
            default is 300 seconds. If set to 0, the file will not be dumped
            at regular intervals, but only when the server is shut down.
  
     These parameters must be set in postgresql.conf. Typical usage might
     be:
  # postgresql.conf
  shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_prewarm'
  
  pg_prewarm.autoprewarm = true
  pg_prewarm.autoprewarm_interval = 300s
