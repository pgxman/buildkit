        F.9. btree_gist -- GiST operator classes with B-tree behavior [7]#

           [8]F.9.1. Example Usage
           [9]F.9.2. Authors

           btree_gist provides GiST index operator classes that implement B-tree
           equivalent behavior for the data types int2, int4, int8, float4,
           float8, numeric, timestamp with time zone, timestamp without time zone,
           time with time zone, time without time zone, date, interval, oid,
           money, char, varchar, text, bytea, bit, varbit, macaddr, macaddr8,
           inet, cidr, uuid, bool and all enum types.

           In general, these operator classes will not outperform the equivalent
           standard B-tree index methods, and they lack one major feature of the
           standard B-tree code: the ability to enforce uniqueness. However, they
           provide some other features that are not available with a B-tree index,
           as described below. Also, these operator classes are useful when a
           multicolumn GiST index is needed, wherein some of the columns are of
           data types that are only indexable with GiST but other columns are just
           simple data types. Lastly, these operator classes are useful for GiST
           testing and as a base for developing other GiST operator classes.

           In addition to the typical B-tree search operators, btree_gist also
           provides index support for <> ("not equals"). This may be useful in
           combination with an [10]exclusion constraint, as described below.

           Also, for data types for which there is a natural distance metric,
           btree_gist defines a distance operator <->, and provides GiST index
           support for nearest-neighbor searches using this operator. Distance
           operators are provided for int2, int4, int8, float4, float8, timestamp
           with time zone, timestamp without time zone, time without time zone,
           date, interval, oid, and money.

           This module is considered "trusted", that is, it can be installed by
           non-superusers who have CREATE privilege on the current database.

        F.9.1. Example Usage [11]#

           Simple example using btree_gist instead of btree:
        CREATE TABLE test (a int4);
        -- create index
        CREATE INDEX testidx ON test USING GIST (a);
        -- query
        SELECT * FROM test WHERE a < 10;
        -- nearest-neighbor search: find the ten entries closest to "42"
        SELECT *, a <-> 42 AS dist FROM test ORDER BY a <-> 42 LIMIT 10;

           Use an [12]exclusion constraint to enforce the rule that a cage at a
           zoo can contain only one kind of animal:
        => CREATE TABLE zoo (
          cage   INTEGER,
          animal TEXT,
          EXCLUDE USING GIST (cage WITH =, animal WITH <>)
        );

        => INSERT INTO zoo VALUES(123, 'zebra');
        INSERT 0 1
        => INSERT INTO zoo VALUES(123, 'zebra');
        INSERT 0 1
        => INSERT INTO zoo VALUES(123, 'lion');
        ERROR:  conflicting key value violates exclusion constraint "zoo_cage_animal_exc
        l"
        DETAIL:  Key (cage, animal)=(123, lion) conflicts with existing key (cage, anima
        l)=(123, zebra).
        => INSERT INTO zoo VALUES(124, 'lion');
        INSERT 0 1
