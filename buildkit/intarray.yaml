           The intarray module provides a number of useful functions and operators
           for manipulating null-free arrays of integers. There is also support
           for indexed searches using some of the operators.

           All of these operations will throw an error if a supplied array
           contains any NULL elements.

           Many of these operations are only sensible for one-dimensional arrays.
           Although they will accept input arrays of more dimensions, the data is
           treated as though it were a linear array in storage order.

           This module is considered "trusted", that is, it can be installed by
           non-superusers who have CREATE privilege on the current database.

        F.20.1. intarray Functions and Operators [13]#

           The functions provided by the intarray module are shown in
           [14]Table F.9, the operators in [15]Table F.10.

           Table F.9. intarray Functions

           Function

           Description

           Example(s)

           icount ( integer[] ) -> integer

           Returns the number of elements in the array.

           icount('{1,2,3}'::integer[]) -> 3

           sort ( integer[], dir text ) -> integer[]

           Sorts the array in either ascending or descending order. dir must be
           asc or desc.

           sort('{1,3,2}'::integer[], 'desc') -> {3,2,1}

           sort ( integer[] ) -> integer[]

           sort_asc ( integer[] ) -> integer[]

           Sorts in ascending order.

           sort(array[11,77,44]) -> {11,44,77}

           sort_desc ( integer[] ) -> integer[]

           Sorts in descending order.

           sort_desc(array[11,77,44]) -> {77,44,11}

           uniq ( integer[] ) -> integer[]

           Removes adjacent duplicates. Often used with sort to remove all
           duplicates.

           uniq('{1,2,2,3,1,1}'::integer[]) -> {1,2,3,1}

           uniq(sort('{1,2,3,2,1}'::integer[])) -> {1,2,3}

           idx ( integer[], item integer ) -> integer

           Returns index of the first array element matching item, or 0 if no
           match.

           idx(array[11,22,33,22,11], 22) -> 2

           subarray ( integer[], start integer, len integer ) -> integer[]

           Extracts the portion of the array starting at position start, with len
           elements.

           subarray('{1,2,3,2,1}'::integer[], 2, 3) -> {2,3,2}

           subarray ( integer[], start integer ) -> integer[]

           Extracts the portion of the array starting at position start.

           subarray('{1,2,3,2,1}'::integer[], 2) -> {2,3,2,1}

           intset ( integer ) -> integer[]

           Makes a single-element array.

           intset(42) -> {42}

           Table F.10. intarray Operators

           Operator

           Description

           integer[] && integer[] -> boolean

           Do arrays overlap (have at least one element in common)?

           integer[] @> integer[] -> boolean

           Does left array contain right array?

           integer[] <@ integer[] -> boolean

           Is left array contained in right array?

           # integer[] -> integer

           Returns the number of elements in the array.

           integer[] # integer -> integer

           Returns index of the first array element matching the right argument,
           or 0 if no match. (Same as idx function.)

           integer[] + integer -> integer[]

           Adds element to end of array.

           integer[] + integer[] -> integer[]

           Concatenates the arrays.

           integer[] - integer -> integer[]

           Removes entries matching the right argument from the array.

           integer[] - integer[] -> integer[]

           Removes elements of the right array from the left array.

           integer[] | integer -> integer[]

           Computes the union of the arguments.

           integer[] | integer[] -> integer[]

           Computes the union of the arguments.

           integer[] & integer[] -> integer[]

           Computes the intersection of the arguments.

           integer[] @@ query_int -> boolean

           Does array satisfy query? (see below)

           query_int ~~ integer[] -> boolean

           Does array satisfy query? (commutator of @@)

           The operators &&, @> and <@ are equivalent to PostgreSQL's built-in
           operators of the same names, except that they work only on integer
           arrays that do not contain nulls, while the built-in operators work for
           any array type. This restriction makes them faster than the built-in
           operators in many cases.

           The @@ and ~~ operators test whether an array satisfies a query, which
           is expressed as a value of a specialized data type query_int. A query
           consists of integer values that are checked against the elements of the
           array, possibly combined using the operators & (AND), | (OR), and !
           (NOT). Parentheses can be used as needed. For example, the query
           1&(2|3) matches arrays that contain 1 and also contain either 2 or 3.

        F.20.2. Index Support [16]#

           intarray provides index support for the &&, @>, and @@ operators, as
           well as regular array equality.

           Two parameterized GiST index operator classes are provided:
           gist__int_ops (used by default) is suitable for small- to medium-size
           data sets, while gist__intbig_ops uses a larger signature and is more
           suitable for indexing large data sets (i.e., columns containing a large
           number of distinct array values). The implementation uses an RD-tree
           data structure with built-in lossy compression.

           gist__int_ops approximates an integer set as an array of integer
           ranges. Its optional integer parameter numranges determines the maximum
           number of ranges in one index key. The default value of numranges is
           100. Valid values are between 1 and 253. Using larger arrays as GiST
           index keys leads to a more precise search (scanning a smaller fraction
           of the index and fewer heap pages), at the cost of a larger index.

           gist__intbig_ops approximates an integer set as a bitmap signature. Its
           optional integer parameter siglen determines the signature length in
           bytes. The default signature length is 16 bytes. Valid values of
           signature length are between 1 and 2024 bytes. Longer signatures lead
           to a more precise search (scanning a smaller fraction of the index and
           fewer heap pages), at the cost of a larger index.

           There is also a non-default GIN operator class gin__int_ops, which
           supports these operators as well as <@.

           The choice between GiST and GIN indexing depends on the relative
           performance characteristics of GiST and GIN, which are discussed
           elsewhere.

        F.20.3. Example [17]#

        -- a message can be in one or more "sections"
        CREATE TABLE message (mid INT PRIMARY KEY, sections INT[], ...);

        -- create specialized index with signature length of 32 bytes
        CREATE INDEX message_rdtree_idx ON message USING GIST (sections gist__intbig_ops
         (siglen = 32));

        -- select messages in section 1 OR 2 - OVERLAP operator
        SELECT message.mid FROM message WHERE message.sections && '{1,2}';

        -- select messages in sections 1 AND 2 - CONTAINS operator
        SELECT message.mid FROM message WHERE message.sections @> '{1,2}';

        -- the same, using QUERY operator
        SELECT message.mid FROM message WHERE message.sections @@ '1&2'::query_int;

        F.20.4. Benchmark [18]#

           The source directory contrib/intarray/bench contains a benchmark test
           suite, which can be run against an installed PostgreSQL server. (It
           also requires DBD::Pg to be installed.) To run:
        cd .../contrib/intarray/bench
        createdb TEST
        psql -c "CREATE EXTENSION intarray" TEST
        ./create_test.pl | psql TEST
        ./bench.pl

           The bench.pl script has numerous options, which are displayed when it
           is run without any arguments.

        F.20.5. Authors [19]#

           All work was done by Teodor Sigaev (<[20]teodor@sigaev.ru>) and Oleg
           Bartunov (<[21]oleg@sai.msu.su>). See

           The intarray module provides a number of useful functions and operators
           for manipulating null-free arrays of integers. There is also support
           for indexed searches using some of the operators.

           All of these operations will throw an error if a supplied array
           contains any NULL elements.

           Many of these operations are only sensible for one-dimensional arrays.
           Although they will accept input arrays of more dimensions, the data is
           treated as though it were a linear array in storage order.

           This module is considered "trusted", that is, it can be installed by
           non-superusers who have CREATE privilege on the current database.

        F.18.1. intarray Functions and Operators

           The functions provided by the intarray module are shown in
           [12]Table F.9, the operators in [13]Table F.10.

           Table F.9. intarray Functions

           Function

           Description

           Example(s)

           icount ( integer[] ) -> integer

           Returns the number of elements in the array.

           icount('{1,2,3}'::integer[]) -> 3

           sort ( integer[], dir text ) -> integer[]

           Sorts the array in either ascending or descending order. dir must be
           asc or desc.

           sort('{1,3,2}'::integer[], 'desc') -> {3,2,1}

           sort ( integer[] ) -> integer[]

           sort_asc ( integer[] ) -> integer[]

           Sorts in ascending order.

           sort(array[11,77,44]) -> {11,44,77}

           sort_desc ( integer[] ) -> integer[]

           Sorts in descending order.

           sort_desc(array[11,77,44]) -> {77,44,11}

           uniq ( integer[] ) -> integer[]

           Removes adjacent duplicates. Often used with sort to remove all
           duplicates.

           uniq('{1,2,2,3,1,1}'::integer[]) -> {1,2,3,1}

           uniq(sort('{1,2,3,2,1}'::integer[])) -> {1,2,3}

           idx ( integer[], item integer ) -> integer

           Returns index of the first array element matching item, or 0 if no
           match.

           idx(array[11,22,33,22,11], 22) -> 2

           subarray ( integer[], start integer, len integer ) -> integer[]

           Extracts the portion of the array starting at position start, with len
           elements.

           subarray('{1,2,3,2,1}'::integer[], 2, 3) -> {2,3,2}

           subarray ( integer[], start integer ) -> integer[]

           Extracts the portion of the array starting at position start.

           subarray('{1,2,3,2,1}'::integer[], 2) -> {2,3,2,1}

           intset ( integer ) -> integer[]

           Makes a single-element array.

           intset(42) -> {42}

           Table F.10. intarray Operators

           Operator

           Description

           integer[] && integer[] -> boolean

           Do arrays overlap (have at least one element in common)?

           integer[] @> integer[] -> boolean

           Does left array contain right array?

           integer[] <@ integer[] -> boolean

           Is left array contained in right array?

           # integer[] -> integer

           Returns the number of elements in the array.

           integer[] # integer -> integer

           Returns index of the first array element matching the right argument,
           or 0 if no match. (Same as idx function.)

           integer[] + integer -> integer[]

           Adds element to end of array.

           integer[] + integer[] -> integer[]

           Concatenates the arrays.

           integer[] - integer -> integer[]

           Removes entries matching the right argument from the array.

           integer[] - integer[] -> integer[]

           Removes elements of the right array from the left array.

           integer[] | integer -> integer[]

           Computes the union of the arguments.

           integer[] | integer[] -> integer[]

           Computes the union of the arguments.

           integer[] & integer[] -> integer[]

           Computes the intersection of the arguments.

           integer[] @@ query_int -> boolean

           Does array satisfy query? (see below)

           query_int ~~ integer[] -> boolean

           Does array satisfy query? (commutator of @@)

           The operators &&, @> and <@ are equivalent to PostgreSQL's built-in
           operators of the same names, except that they work only on integer
           arrays that do not contain nulls, while the built-in operators work for
           any array type. This restriction makes them faster than the built-in
           operators in many cases.

           The @@ and ~~ operators test whether an array satisfies a query, which
           is expressed as a value of a specialized data type query_int. A query
           consists of integer values that are checked against the elements of the
           array, possibly combined using the operators & (AND), | (OR), and !
           (NOT). Parentheses can be used as needed. For example, the query
           1&(2|3) matches arrays that contain 1 and also contain either 2 or 3.

        F.18.2. Index Support

           intarray provides index support for the &&, @>, and @@ operators, as
           well as regular array equality.

           Two parameterized GiST index operator classes are provided:
           gist__int_ops (used by default) is suitable for small- to medium-size
           data sets, while gist__intbig_ops uses a larger signature and is more
           suitable for indexing large data sets (i.e., columns containing a large
           number of distinct array values). The implementation uses an RD-tree
           data structure with built-in lossy compression.

           gist__int_ops approximates an integer set as an array of integer
           ranges. Its optional integer parameter numranges determines the maximum
           number of ranges in one index key. The default value of numranges is
           100. Valid values are between 1 and 253. Using larger arrays as GiST
           index keys leads to a more precise search (scanning a smaller fraction
           of the index and fewer heap pages), at the cost of a larger index.

           gist__intbig_ops approximates an integer set as a bitmap signature. Its
           optional integer parameter siglen determines the signature length in
           bytes. The default signature length is 16 bytes. Valid values of
           signature length are between 1 and 2024 bytes. Longer signatures lead
           to a more precise search (scanning a smaller fraction of the index and
           fewer heap pages), at the cost of a larger index.

           There is also a non-default GIN operator class gin__int_ops, which
           supports these operators as well as <@.

           The choice between GiST and GIN indexing depends on the relative
           performance characteristics of GiST and GIN, which are discussed
           elsewhere.

        F.18.3. Example

        -- a message can be in one or more "sections"
        CREATE TABLE message (mid INT PRIMARY KEY, sections INT[], ...);

        -- create specialized index with signature length of 32 bytes
        CREATE INDEX message_rdtree_idx ON message USING GIST (sections gist__intbig_ops
         (siglen = 32));

        -- select messages in section 1 OR 2 - OVERLAP operator
        SELECT message.mid FROM message WHERE message.sections && '{1,2}';

        -- select messages in sections 1 AND 2 - CONTAINS operator
        SELECT message.mid FROM message WHERE message.sections @> '{1,2}';

        -- the same, using QUERY operator
        SELECT message.mid FROM message WHERE message.sections @@ '1&2'::query_int;

        F.18.4. Benchmark

           The source directory contrib/intarray/bench contains a benchmark test
           suite, which can be run against an installed PostgreSQL server. (It
           also requires DBD::Pg to be installed.) To run:
        cd .../contrib/intarray/bench
        createdb TEST
        psql -c "CREATE EXTENSION intarray" TEST
        ./create_test.pl | psql TEST
        ./bench.pl

           The bench.pl script has numerous options, which are displayed when it
           is run without any arguments.

        F.18.5. Authors

           All work was done by Teodor Sigaev (<[14]teodor@sigaev.ru>) and Oleg
           Bartunov (<[15]oleg@sai.msu.su>). See

           Does array satisfy query? (commutator of @@)

           (Before PostgreSQL 8.2, the containment operators @> and <@ were

           deprecated and will eventually be retired. Notice that the old names
           are reversed from the convention formerly followed by the core
           geometric data types!)
