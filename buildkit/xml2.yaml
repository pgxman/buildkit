           The xml2 module provides XPath querying and XSLT functionality.

        F.50.1. Deprecation Notice [13]#

           From PostgreSQL 8.3 on, there is XML-related functionality based on the
           SQL/XML standard in the core server. That functionality covers XML
           syntax checking and XPath queries, which is what this module does, and
           more, but the API is not at all compatible. It is planned that this
           module will be removed in a future version of PostgreSQL in favor of
           the newer standard API, so you are encouraged to try converting your
           applications. If you find that some of the functionality of this module
           is not available in an adequate form with the newer API, please explain
           your issue to <[14]pgsql-hackers@lists.postgresql.org> so that the
           deficiency can be addressed.

        F.50.2. Description of Functions [15]#

           [16]Table F.36 shows the functions provided by this module. These
           functions provide straightforward XML parsing and XPath queries.

           Table F.36. xml2 Functions

           Function

           Description

           xml_valid ( document text ) -> boolean

           Parses the given document and returns true if the document is
           well-formed XML. (Note: this is an alias for the standard PostgreSQL
           function xml_is_well_formed(). The name xml_valid() is technically
           incorrect since validity and well-formedness have different meanings in
           XML.)

           xpath_string ( document text, query text ) -> text

           Evaluates the XPath query on the supplied document, and casts the
           result to text.

           xpath_number ( document text, query text ) -> real

           Evaluates the XPath query on the supplied document, and casts the
           result to real.

           xpath_bool ( document text, query text ) -> boolean

           Evaluates the XPath query on the supplied document, and casts the
           result to boolean.

           xpath_nodeset ( document text, query text, toptag text, itemtag text )
           -> text

           Evaluates the query on the document and wraps the result in XML tags.
           If the result is multivalued, the output will look like:
        <toptag>
        <itemtag>Value 1 which could be an XML fragment</itemtag>
        <itemtag>Value 2....</itemtag>
        </toptag>

           If either toptag or itemtag is an empty string, the relevant tag is
           omitted.

           xpath_nodeset ( document text, query text, itemtag text ) -> text

           Like xpath_nodeset(document, query, toptag, itemtag) but result omits
           toptag.

           xpath_nodeset ( document text, query text ) -> text

           Like xpath_nodeset(document, query, toptag, itemtag) but result omits
           both tags.

           xpath_list ( document text, query text, separator text ) -> text

           Evaluates the query on the document and returns multiple values
           separated by the specified separator, for example Value 1,Value 2,Value
           3 if separator is ,.

           xpath_list ( document text, query text ) -> text

           This is a wrapper for the above function that uses , as the separator.

        F.50.3. xpath_table [17]#

        xpath_table(text key, text document, text relation, text xpaths, text criteria)
        returns setof record

           xpath_table is a table function that evaluates a set of XPath queries
           on each of a set of documents and returns the results as a table. The
           primary key field from the original document table is returned as the
           first column of the result so that the result set can readily be used
           in joins. The parameters are described in [18]Table F.37.

           Table F.37. xpath_table Parameters
           Parameter Description
           key

           the name of the "key" field -- this is just a field to be used as the
           first column of the output table, i.e., it identifies the record from
           which each output row came (see note below about multiple values)
           document

           the name of the field containing the XML document
           relation

           the name of the table or view containing the documents
           xpaths

           one or more XPath expressions, separated by |
           criteria

           the contents of the WHERE clause. This cannot be omitted, so use true
           or 1=1 if you want to process all the rows in the relation

           These parameters (except the XPath strings) are just substituted into a
           plain SQL SELECT statement, so you have some flexibility -- the
           statement is

           SELECT <key>, <document> FROM <relation> WHERE <criteria>

           so those parameters can be anything valid in those particular
           locations. The result from this SELECT needs to return exactly two
           columns (which it will unless you try to list multiple fields for key
           or document). Beware that this simplistic approach requires that you
           validate any user-supplied values to avoid SQL injection attacks.

           The function has to be used in a FROM expression, with an AS clause to
           specify the output columns; for example
        SELECT * FROM
        xpath_table('article_id',
                    'article_xml',
                    'articles',
                    '/article/author|/article/pages|/article/title',
                    'date_entered > ''2003-01-01'' ')
        AS t(article_id integer, author text, page_count integer, title text);

           The AS clause defines the names and types of the columns in the output
           table. The first is the "key" field and the rest correspond to the
           XPath queries. If there are more XPath queries than result columns, the
           extra queries will be ignored. If there are more result columns than
           XPath queries, the extra columns will be NULL.

           Notice that this example defines the page_count result column as an
           integer. The function deals internally with string representations, so
           when you say you want an integer in the output, it will take the string
           representation of the XPath result and use PostgreSQL input functions
           to transform it into an integer (or whatever type the AS clause
           requests). An error will result if it can't do this -- for example if
           the result is empty -- so you may wish to just stick to text as the
           column type if you think your data has any problems.

           The calling SELECT statement doesn't necessarily have to be just SELECT
           * -- it can reference the output columns by name or join them to other
           tables. The function produces a virtual table with which you can
           perform any operation you wish (e.g., aggregation, joining, sorting
           etc.). So we could also have:
        SELECT t.title, p.fullname, p.email
        FROM xpath_table('article_id', 'article_xml', 'articles',
                         '/article/title|/article/author/@id',
                         'xpath_string(article_xml,''/article/@date'') > ''2003-03-20''
        ')
               AS t(article_id integer, title text, author_id integer),
             tblPeopleInfo AS p
        WHERE t.author_id = p.person_id;

           as a more complicated example. Of course, you could wrap all of this in
           a view for convenience.

        F.50.3.1. Multivalued Results [19]#

           The xpath_table function assumes that the results of each XPath query
           might be multivalued, so the number of rows returned by the function
           may not be the same as the number of input documents. The first row
           returned contains the first result from each query, the second row the
           second result from each query. If one of the queries has fewer values
           than the others, null values will be returned instead.

           In some cases, a user will know that a given XPath query will return
           only a single result (perhaps a unique document identifier) -- if used
           alongside an XPath query returning multiple results, the single-valued
           result will appear only on the first row of the result. The solution to
           this is to use the key field as part of a join against a simpler XPath
           query. As an example:
        CREATE TABLE test (
            id int PRIMARY KEY,
            xml text
        );

        INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, '<doc num="C1">
        <line num="L1"><a>1</a><b>2</b><c>3</c></line>
        <line num="L2"><a>11</a><b>22</b><c>33</c></line>
        </doc>');

        INSERT INTO test VALUES (2, '<doc num="C2">
        <line num="L1"><a>111</a><b>222</b><c>333</c></line>
        <line num="L2"><a>111</a><b>222</b><c>333</c></line>
        </doc>');

        SELECT * FROM
          xpath_table('id','xml','test',
                      '/doc/@num|/doc/line/@num|/doc/line/a|/doc/line/b|/doc/line/c',
                      'true')
          AS t(id int, doc_num varchar(10), line_num varchar(10), val1 int, val2 int, va
        l3 int)
        WHERE id = 1 ORDER BY doc_num, line_num

         id | doc_num | line_num | val1 | val2 | val3
        ----+---------+----------+------+------+------
          1 | C1      | L1       |    1 |    2 |    3
          1 |         | L2       |   11 |   22 |   33

           To get doc_num on every line, the solution is to use two invocations of
           xpath_table and join the results:
        SELECT t.*,i.doc_num FROM
          xpath_table('id', 'xml', 'test',
                      '/doc/line/@num|/doc/line/a|/doc/line/b|/doc/line/c',
                      'true')
            AS t(id int, line_num varchar(10), val1 int, val2 int, val3 int),
          xpath_table('id', 'xml', 'test', '/doc/@num', 'true')
            AS i(id int, doc_num varchar(10))
        WHERE i.id=t.id AND i.id=1
        ORDER BY doc_num, line_num;

         id | line_num | val1 | val2 | val3 | doc_num
        ----+----------+------+------+------+---------
          1 | L1       |    1 |    2 |    3 | C1
          1 | L2       |   11 |   22 |   33 | C1
        (2 rows)

        F.50.4. XSLT Functions [20]#

           The following functions are available if libxslt is installed:

        F.50.4.1. xslt_process [21]#

        xslt_process(text document, text stylesheet, text paramlist) returns text

           This function applies the XSL stylesheet to the document and returns
           the transformed result. The paramlist is a list of parameter
           assignments to be used in the transformation, specified in the form
           a=1,b=2. Note that the parameter parsing is very simple-minded:
           parameter values cannot contain commas!

           There is also a two-parameter version of xslt_process which does not
           pass any parameters to the transformation.

           integer. The function deals internally with string representations, so
           when you say you want an integer in the output, it will take the string
           representation of the XPath result and use PostgreSQL input functions
           to transform it into an integer (or whatever type the AS clause
           requests). An error will result if it can't do this -- for example if
           the result is empty -- so you may wish to just stick to text as the
           column type if you think your data has any problems.

           The calling SELECT statement doesn't necessarily have to be just SELECT
           * -- it can reference the output columns by name or join them to other
           tables. The function produces a virtual table with which you can
           perform any operation you wish (e.g., aggregation, joining, sorting
           etc.). So we could also have:
        SELECT t.title, p.fullname, p.email
        FROM xpath_table('article_id', 'article_xml', 'articles',
                         '/article/title|/article/author/@id',
                         'xpath_string(article_xml,''/article/@date'') > ''2003-03-20''
        ')
               AS t(article_id integer, title text, author_id integer),
             tblPeopleInfo AS p
        WHERE t.author_id = p.person_id;

           as a more complicated example. Of course, you could wrap all of this in
           a view for convenience.

        F.50.3.1. Multivalued Results

           The xpath_table function assumes that the results of each XPath query
           might be multivalued, so the number of rows returned by the function
           may not be the same as the number of input documents. The first row
           returned contains the first result from each query, the second row the
           second result from each query. If one of the queries has fewer values
           than the others, null values will be returned instead.

           In some cases, a user will know that a given XPath query will return
           only a single result (perhaps a unique document identifier) -- if used
           alongside an XPath query returning multiple results, the single-valued
           result will appear only on the first row of the result. The solution to
           this is to use the key field as part of a join against a simpler XPath
           query. As an example:
        CREATE TABLE test (
            id int PRIMARY KEY,
            xml text
        );

        INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, '<doc num="C1">
        <line num="L1"><a>1</a><b>2</b><c>3</c></line>
        <line num="L2"><a>11</a><b>22</b><c>33</c></line>
        </doc>');

        INSERT INTO test VALUES (2, '<doc num="C2">
        <line num="L1"><a>111</a><b>222</b><c>333</c></line>
        <line num="L2"><a>111</a><b>222</b><c>333</c></line>
        </doc>');

        SELECT * FROM
          xpath_table('id','xml','test',
                      '/doc/@num|/doc/line/@num|/doc/line/a|/doc/line/b|/doc/line/c',
                      'true')
          AS t(id int, doc_num varchar(10), line_num varchar(10), val1 int, val2 int, va
        l3 int)
        WHERE id = 1 ORDER BY doc_num, line_num

         id | doc_num | line_num | val1 | val2 | val3
        ----+---------+----------+------+------+------
          1 | C1      | L1       |    1 |    2 |    3
          1 |         | L2       |   11 |   22 |   33

           To get doc_num on every line, the solution is to use two invocations of
           xpath_table and join the results:
        SELECT t.*,i.doc_num FROM
          xpath_table('id', 'xml', 'test',
                      '/doc/line/@num|/doc/line/a|/doc/line/b|/doc/line/c',
                      'true')
            AS t(id int, line_num varchar(10), val1 int, val2 int, val3 int),
          xpath_table('id', 'xml', 'test', '/doc/@num', 'true')
            AS i(id int, doc_num varchar(10))
        WHERE i.id=t.id AND i.id=1
        ORDER BY doc_num, line_num;

         id | line_num | val1 | val2 | val3 | doc_num
        ----+----------+------+------+------+---------
          1 | L1       |    1 |    2 |    3 | C1
          1 | L2       |   11 |   22 |   33 | C1
        (2 rows)

        F.50.4. XSLT Functions

           The following functions are available if libxslt is installed:

        F.50.4.1. xslt_process

        xslt_process(text document, text stylesheet, text paramlist) returns text

           This function applies the XSL stylesheet to the document and returns
           the transformed result. The paramlist is a list of parameter
           assignments to be used in the transformation, specified in the form
           a=1,b=2. Note that the parameter parsing is very simple-minded:
           parameter values cannot contain commas!

           There is also a two-parameter version of xslt_process which does not
           pass any parameters to the transformation.

           [11]F.47.5. Author

           The xml2 module provides XPath querying and XSLT functionality.

        F.47.1. Deprecation Notice

           From PostgreSQL 8.3 on, there is XML-related functionality based on the
           SQL/XML standard in the core server. That functionality covers XML
           syntax checking and XPath queries, which is what this module does, and
           more, but the API is not at all compatible. It is planned that this
           module will be removed in a future version of PostgreSQL in favor of
           the newer standard API, so you are encouraged to try converting your
           applications. If you find that some of the functionality of this module
           is not available in an adequate form with the newer API, please explain
           your issue to <[12]pgsql-hackers@lists.postgresql.org> so that the
           deficiency can be addressed.

        F.47.2. Description of Functions

           [13]Table F.35 shows the functions provided by this module. These
           functions provide straightforward XML parsing and XPath queries.

           Table F.35. xml2 Functions

           Function

           Description

           xml_valid ( document text ) -> boolean

           Parses the given document and returns true if the document is
           well-formed XML. (Note: this is an alias for the standard PostgreSQL
           function xml_is_well_formed(). The name xml_valid() is technically
           incorrect since validity and well-formedness have different meanings in
           XML.)

           xpath_string ( document text, query text ) -> text

           Evaluates the XPath query on the supplied document, and casts the
           result to text.

           xpath_number ( document text, query text ) -> real

           Evaluates the XPath query on the supplied document, and casts the
           result to real.

           xpath_bool ( document text, query text ) -> boolean

           Evaluates the XPath query on the supplied document, and casts the
           result to boolean.

           xpath_nodeset ( document text, query text, toptag text, itemtag text )
           -> text

           Evaluates the query on the document and wraps the result in XML tags.
           If the result is multivalued, the output will look like:
        <toptag>
        <itemtag>Value 1 which could be an XML fragment</itemtag>
        <itemtag>Value 2....</itemtag>
        </toptag>

           If either toptag or itemtag is an empty string, the relevant tag is
           omitted.

           xpath_nodeset ( document text, query text, itemtag text ) -> text

           Like xpath_nodeset(document, query, toptag, itemtag) but result omits
           toptag.

           xpath_nodeset ( document text, query text ) -> text

           Like xpath_nodeset(document, query, toptag, itemtag) but result omits
           both tags.

           xpath_list ( document text, query text, separator text ) -> text

           Evaluates the query on the document and returns multiple values
           separated by the specified separator, for example Value 1,Value 2,Value
           3 if separator is ,.

           xpath_list ( document text, query text ) -> text

           This is a wrapper for the above function that uses , as the separator.

        F.47.3. xpath_table

        xpath_table(text key, text document, text relation, text xpaths, text criteria)
        returns setof record

           xpath_table is a table function that evaluates a set of XPath queries
           on each of a set of documents and returns the results as a table. The
           primary key field from the original document table is returned as the
           first column of the result so that the result set can readily be used
           in joins. The parameters are described in [14]Table F.36.

           Table F.36. xpath_table Parameters
           Parameter Description
           key

           the name of the "key" field -- this is just a field to be used as the
           first column of the output table, i.e., it identifies the record from
           which each output row came (see note below about multiple values)
           document

           the name of the field containing the XML document
           relation

           the name of the table or view containing the documents
           xpaths

           one or more XPath expressions, separated by |
           criteria

           the contents of the WHERE clause. This cannot be omitted, so use true
           or 1=1 if you want to process all the rows in the relation

           These parameters (except the XPath strings) are just substituted into a
           plain SQL SELECT statement, so you have some flexibility -- the
           statement is

           SELECT <key>, <document> FROM <relation> WHERE <criteria>

           so those parameters can be anything valid in those particular
           locations. The result from this SELECT needs to return exactly two
           columns (which it will unless you try to list multiple fields for key
           or document). Beware that this simplistic approach requires that you
           validate any user-supplied values to avoid SQL injection attacks.

           The function has to be used in a FROM expression, with an AS clause to
           specify the output columns; for example
        SELECT * FROM
        xpath_table('article_id',
                    'article_xml',
                    'articles',
                    '/article/author|/article/pages|/article/title',
                    'date_entered > ''2003-01-01'' ')
        AS t(article_id integer, author text, page_count integer, title text);

           The AS clause defines the names and types of the columns in the output
           table. The first is the "key" field and the rest correspond to the
           XPath queries. If there are more XPath queries than result columns, the
           extra queries will be ignored. If there are more result columns than
           XPath queries, the extra columns will be NULL.

           Notice that this example defines the page_count result column as an
           integer. The function deals internally with string representations, so
           when you say you want an integer in the output, it will take the string
           representation of the XPath result and use PostgreSQL input functions
           to transform it into an integer (or whatever type the AS clause
           requests). An error will result if it can't do this -- for example if
           the result is empty -- so you may wish to just stick to text as the
           column type if you think your data has any problems.

           The calling SELECT statement doesn't necessarily have to be just SELECT
           * -- it can reference the output columns by name or join them to other
           tables. The function produces a virtual table with which you can
           perform any operation you wish (e.g., aggregation, joining, sorting
           etc). So we could also have:
        SELECT t.title, p.fullname, p.email
        FROM xpath_table('article_id', 'article_xml', 'articles',
                         '/article/title|/article/author/@id',
                         'xpath_string(article_xml,''/article/@date'') > ''2003-03-20''
        ')
               AS t(article_id integer, title text, author_id integer),
             tblPeopleInfo AS p
        WHERE t.author_id = p.person_id;

           as a more complicated example. Of course, you could wrap all of this in
           a view for convenience.

        F.47.3.1. Multivalued Results

           The xpath_table function assumes that the results of each XPath query
           might be multivalued, so the number of rows returned by the function
           may not be the same as the number of input documents. The first row
           returned contains the first result from each query, the second row the
           second result from each query. If one of the queries has fewer values
           than the others, null values will be returned instead.

           In some cases, a user will know that a given XPath query will return
           only a single result (perhaps a unique document identifier) -- if used
           alongside an XPath query returning multiple results, the single-valued
           result will appear only on the first row of the result. The solution to
           this is to use the key field as part of a join against a simpler XPath
           query. As an example:
        CREATE TABLE test (
            id int PRIMARY KEY,
            xml text
        );

        INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, '<doc num="C1">
        <line num="L1"><a>1</a><b>2</b><c>3</c></line>
        <line num="L2"><a>11</a><b>22</b><c>33</c></line>
        </doc>');

        INSERT INTO test VALUES (2, '<doc num="C2">
        <line num="L1"><a>111</a><b>222</b><c>333</c></line>
        <line num="L2"><a>111</a><b>222</b><c>333</c></line>
        </doc>');

        SELECT * FROM
          xpath_table('id','xml','test',
                      '/doc/@num|/doc/line/@num|/doc/line/a|/doc/line/b|/doc/line/c',
                      'true')
          AS t(id int, doc_num varchar(10), line_num varchar(10), val1 int, val2 int, va
        l3 int)
        WHERE id = 1 ORDER BY doc_num, line_num

         id | doc_num | line_num | val1 | val2 | val3
        ----+---------+----------+------+------+------
          1 | C1      | L1       |    1 |    2 |    3
          1 |         | L2       |   11 |   22 |   33

        SELECT t.*,i.doc_num FROM

                      '/doc/line/@num|/doc/line/a|/doc/line/b|/doc/line/c',
                      'true')
            AS t(id int, line_num varchar(10), val1 int, val2 int, val3 int),
          xpath_table('id', 'xml', 'test', '/doc/@num', 'true')
            AS i(id int, doc_num varchar(10))
        WHERE i.id=t.id AND i.id=1
        ORDER BY doc_num, line_num;

         id | line_num | val1 | val2 | val3 | doc_num
        ----+----------+------+------+------+---------
          1 | L1       |    1 |    2 |    3 | C1
          1 | L2       |   11 |   22 |   33 | C1
        (2 rows)

        F.47.4. XSLT Functions

           The following functions are available if libxslt is installed:

        F.47.4.1. xslt_process

        xslt_process(text document, text stylesheet, text paramlist) returns text

           This function applies the XSL stylesheet to the document and returns
           the transformed result. The paramlist is a list of parameter

           From PostgreSQL 8.3 on, there is XML-related functionality based on the
           SQL/XML standard in the core server. That functionality covers XML
           syntax checking and XPath queries, which is what this module does, and
           more, but the API is not at all compatible. It is planned that this
           module will be removed in a future version of PostgreSQL in favor of
           the newer standard API, so you are encouraged to try converting your
           applications. If you find that some of the functionality of this module
           is not available in an adequate form with the newer API, please explain
           your issue to <[12]pgsql-hackers@lists.postgresql.org> so that the
           deficiency can be addressed.

        F.45.2. Description of Functions

           [13]Table F.34 shows the functions provided by this module. These
           functions provide straightforward XML parsing and XPath queries.

           Table F.34. xml2 Functions

           Function

           Description

           xml_valid ( document text ) -> boolean

           Parses the given document and returns true if the document is
           well-formed XML. (Note: this is an alias for the standard PostgreSQL
           function xml_is_well_formed(). The name xml_valid() is technically
           incorrect since validity and well-formedness have different meanings in
           XML.)

           xpath_string ( document text, query text ) -> text

           Evaluates the XPath query on the supplied document, and casts the
           result to text.

           xpath_number ( document text, query text ) -> real

           Evaluates the XPath query on the supplied document, and casts the
           result to real.

           xpath_bool ( document text, query text ) -> boolean

           Evaluates the XPath query on the supplied document, and casts the
           result to boolean.

           xpath_nodeset ( document text, query text, toptag text, itemtag text )
           -> text

           Evaluates the query on the document and wraps the result in XML tags.
           If the result is multivalued, the output will look like:
        <toptag>
        <itemtag>Value 1 which could be an XML fragment</itemtag>
        <itemtag>Value 2....</itemtag>
        </toptag>

           If either toptag or itemtag is an empty string, the relevant tag is
           omitted.

           xpath_nodeset ( document text, query text, itemtag text ) -> text

           Like xpath_nodeset(document, query, toptag, itemtag) but result omits
           toptag.

           xpath_nodeset ( document text, query text ) -> text

           Like xpath_nodeset(document, query, toptag, itemtag) but result omits
           both tags.

           xpath_list ( document text, query text, separator text ) -> text

           Evaluates the query on the document and returns multiple values
           separated by the specified separator, for example Value 1,Value 2,Value
           3 if separator is ,.

           xpath_list ( document text, query text ) -> text

           This is a wrapper for the above function that uses , as the separator.

        F.45.3. xpath_table

        xpath_table(text key, text document, text relation, text xpaths, text criteria)
        returns setof record

           xpath_table is a table function that evaluates a set of XPath queries
           on each of a set of documents and returns the results as a table. The
           primary key field from the original document table is returned as the
           first column of the result so that the result set can readily be used
           in joins. The parameters are described in [14]Table F.35.

           Table F.35. xpath_table Parameters
           Parameter Description
           key

           the name of the "key" field -- this is just a field to be used as the
           first column of the output table, i.e., it identifies the record from
           which each output row came (see note below about multiple values)
           document

           the name of the field containing the XML document
           relation

           the name of the table or view containing the documents
           xpaths

           one or more XPath expressions, separated by |
           criteria

           the contents of the WHERE clause. This cannot be omitted, so use true
           or 1=1 if you want to process all the rows in the relation

           These parameters (except the XPath strings) are just substituted into a
           plain SQL SELECT statement, so you have some flexibility -- the
           statement is

           SELECT <key>, <document> FROM <relation> WHERE <criteria>

           so those parameters can be anything valid in those particular
           locations. The result from this SELECT needs to return exactly two
           columns (which it will unless you try to list multiple fields for key
           or document). Beware that this simplistic approach requires that you
           validate any user-supplied values to avoid SQL injection attacks.

           The function has to be used in a FROM expression, with an AS clause to
           specify the output columns; for example
        SELECT * FROM
        xpath_table('article_id',
                    'article_xml',
                    'articles',
                    '/article/author|/article/pages|/article/title',
                    'date_entered > ''2003-01-01'' ')
        AS t(article_id integer, author text, page_count integer, title text);

           The AS clause defines the names and types of the columns in the output
           table. The first is the "key" field and the rest correspond to the
           XPath queries. If there are more XPath queries than result columns, the
           extra queries will be ignored. If there are more result columns than
           XPath queries, the extra columns will be NULL.

           Notice that this example defines the page_count result column as an
           integer. The function deals internally with string representations, so
           when you say you want an integer in the output, it will take the string
           representation of the XPath result and use PostgreSQL input functions
           to transform it into an integer (or whatever type the AS clause
           requests). An error will result if it can't do this -- for example if
           the result is empty -- so you may wish to just stick to text as the
           column type if you think your data has any problems.

           The calling SELECT statement doesn't necessarily have to be just SELECT
           * -- it can reference the output columns by name or join them to other
           tables. The function produces a virtual table with which you can
           perform any operation you wish (e.g., aggregation, joining, sorting
           etc). So we could also have:
        SELECT t.title, p.fullname, p.email
        FROM xpath_table('article_id', 'article_xml', 'articles',
                         '/article/title|/article/author/@id',
                         'xpath_string(article_xml,''/article/@date'') > ''2003-03-20''
        ')
               AS t(article_id integer, title text, author_id integer),
             tblPeopleInfo AS p
        WHERE t.author_id = p.person_id;

           as a more complicated example. Of course, you could wrap all of this in
           a view for convenience.

        F.45.3.1. Multivalued Results

           The xpath_table function assumes that the results of each XPath query
           might be multivalued, so the number of rows returned by the function
           may not be the same as the number of input documents. The first row
           returned contains the first result from each query, the second row the
           second result from each query. If one of the queries has fewer values
           than the others, null values will be returned instead.

           In some cases, a user will know that a given XPath query will return
           only a single result (perhaps a unique document identifier) -- if used
           alongside an XPath query returning multiple results, the single-valued
           result will appear only on the first row of the result. The solution to
           this is to use the key field as part of a join against a simpler XPath
           query. As an example:
        CREATE TABLE test (
            id int PRIMARY KEY,
            xml text
        );

        INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, '<doc num="C1">
        <line num="L1"><a>1</a><b>2</b><c>3</c></line>
        <line num="L2"><a>11</a><b>22</b><c>33</c></line>
        </doc>');

        INSERT INTO test VALUES (2, '<doc num="C2">
        <line num="L1"><a>111</a><b>222</b><c>333</c></line>
        <line num="L2"><a>111</a><b>222</b><c>333</c></line>
        </doc>');

        SELECT * FROM
          xpath_table('id','xml','test',
                      '/doc/@num|/doc/line/@num|/doc/line/a|/doc/line/b|/doc/line/c',
                      'true')
          AS t(id int, doc_num varchar(10), line_num varchar(10), val1 int, val2 int, va
        l3 int)
        WHERE id = 1 ORDER BY doc_num, line_num

         id | doc_num | line_num | val1 | val2 | val3
        ----+---------+----------+------+------+------
          1 | C1      | L1       |    1 |    2 |    3
          1 |         | L2       |   11 |   22 |   33

           To get doc_num on every line, the solution is to use two invocations of
           xpath_table and join the results:
        SELECT t.*,i.doc_num FROM
          xpath_table('id', 'xml', 'test',
                      '/doc/line/@num|/doc/line/a|/doc/line/b|/doc/line/c',
                      'true')
            AS t(id int, line_num varchar(10), val1 int, val2 int, val3 int),
          xpath_table('id', 'xml', 'test', '/doc/@num', 'true')
            AS i(id int, doc_num varchar(10))
        WHERE i.id=t.id AND i.id=1
        ORDER BY doc_num, line_num;

         id | line_num | val1 | val2 | val3 | doc_num
        ----+----------+------+------+------+---------
          1 | L1       |    1 |    2 |    3 | C1
          1 | L2       |   11 |   22 |   33 | C1
        (2 rows)

        F.45.4. XSLT Functions

           The following functions are available if libxslt is installed:

        F.45.4.1. xslt_process

        xslt_process(text document, text stylesheet, text paramlist) returns text

           This function applies the XSL stylesheet to the document and returns
           the transformed result. The paramlist is a list of parameter
           assignments to be used in the transformation, specified in the form
           a=1,b=2. Note that the parameter parsing is very simple-minded:
           parameter values cannot contain commas!

           There is also a two-parameter version of xslt_process which does not
           pass any parameters to the transformation.
