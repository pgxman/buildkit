  F.14. dict_xsyn
  
     F.14.1. Configuration
     F.14.2. Usage
  
     dict_xsyn (Extended Synonym Dictionary) is an example of an add-on
     dictionary template for full-text search. This dictionary type replaces
     words with groups of their synonyms, and so makes it possible to search
     for a word using any of its synonyms.
  
  F.14.1. Configuration
  
     A dict_xsyn dictionary accepts the following options:
       * matchorig controls whether the original word is accepted by the
         dictionary. Default is true.
       * matchsynonyms controls whether the synonyms are accepted by the
         dictionary. Default is false.
       * keeporig controls whether the original word is included in the
         dictionary's output. Default is true.
       * keepsynonyms controls whether the synonyms are included in the
         dictionary's output. Default is true.
       * rules is the base name of the file containing the list of synonyms.
         This file must be stored in $SHAREDIR/tsearch_data/ (where
         $SHAREDIR means the PostgreSQL installation's shared-data
         directory). Its name must end in .rules (which is not to be
         included in the rules parameter).
  
     The rules file has the following format:
       * Each line represents a group of synonyms for a single word, which
         is given first on the line. Synonyms are separated by whitespace,
         thus:
  word syn1 syn2 syn3
  
       * The sharp (#) sign is a comment delimiter. It may appear at any
         position in a line. The rest of the line will be skipped.
  
     Look at xsyn_sample.rules, which is installed in
     $SHAREDIR/tsearch_data/, for an example.
  
  F.14.2. Usage
  
     Installing the dict_xsyn extension creates a text search template
     xsyn_template and a dictionary xsyn based on it, with default
     parameters. You can alter the parameters, for example
  mydb# ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY xsyn (RULES='my_rules', KEEPORIG=false);
  ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY
  
     or create new dictionaries based on the template.
  
     To test the dictionary, you can try
  mydb=# SELECT ts_lexize('xsyn', 'word');
        ts_lexize
  -----------------------
   {syn1,syn2,syn3}
  
  mydb# ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY xsyn (RULES='my_rules', KEEPORIG=true);
  ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY
  
  mydb=# SELECT ts_lexize('xsyn', 'word');
        ts_lexize
  -----------------------
   {word,syn1,syn2,syn3}
  
  mydb# ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY xsyn (RULES='my_rules', KEEPORIG=false, MATCH
  SYNONYMS=true);
  ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY
  
  mydb=# SELECT ts_lexize('xsyn', 'syn1');
        ts_lexize
  -----------------------
   {syn1,syn2,syn3}
  
  mydb# ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY xsyn (RULES='my_rules', KEEPORIG=true, MATCHO
  RIG=false, KEEPSYNONYMS=false);
  ALTER TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY
  
  mydb=# SELECT ts_lexize('xsyn', 'syn1');
        ts_lexize
  -----------------------
   {word}
  
     Real-world usage will involve including it in a text search
     configuration as described in Chapter 12. That might look like this:
  ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION english
      ALTER MAPPING FOR word, asciiword WITH xsyn, english_stem;
