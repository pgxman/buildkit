     F.34.1. Functions
     F.34.2. Authors
  
     The pg_surgery module provides various functions to perform surgery on
     a damaged relation. These functions are unsafe by design and using them
     may corrupt (or further corrupt) your database. For example, these
     functions can easily be used to make a table inconsistent with its own
     indexes, to cause UNIQUE or FOREIGN KEY constraint violations, or even
     to make tuples visible which, when read, will cause a database server
     crash. They should be used with great caution and only as a last
     resort.
  
  F.34.1. Functions
  
     heap_force_kill(regclass, tid[]) returns void
            heap_force_kill marks "used" line pointers as "dead" without
            examining the tuples. The intended use of this function is to
            forcibly remove tuples that are not otherwise accessible. For
            example:
  
  test=> select * from t1 where ctid = '(0, 1)';
  ERROR:  could not access status of transaction 4007513275
  DETAIL:  Could not open file "pg_xact/0EED": No such file or directory.
  
  test=# select heap_force_kill('t1'::regclass, ARRAY['(0, 1)']::tid[]);
   heap_force_kill
  -----------------
  
  (1 row)
  
  test=# select * from t1 where ctid = '(0, 1)';
  (0 rows)
  
  
     heap_force_freeze(regclass, tid[]) returns void
            heap_force_freeze marks tuples as frozen without examining the
            tuple data. The intended use of this function is to make
            accessible tuples which are inaccessible due to corrupted
            visibility information, or which prevent the table from being
            successfully vacuumed due to corrupted visibility information.
            For example:
  
  test=> vacuum t1;
  ERROR:  found xmin 507 from before relfrozenxid 515
  CONTEXT:  while scanning block 0 of relation "public.t1"
  
  test=# select ctid from t1 where xmin = 507;
   ctid
  -------
   (0,3)
  (1 row)
  
  test=# select heap_force_freeze('t1'::regclass, ARRAY['(0, 3)']::tid[]);
   heap_force_freeze
  -------------------
  
  (1 row)
  
  test=# select ctid from t1 where xmin = 2;
   ctid
  -------
   (0,3)
  (1 row)
