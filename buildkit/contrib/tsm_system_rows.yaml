  F.46. tsm_system_rows
  
     F.46.1. Examples
  
     The tsm_system_rows module provides the table sampling method
     SYSTEM_ROWS, which can be used in the TABLESAMPLE clause of a SELECT
     command.
  
     This table sampling method accepts a single integer argument that is
     the maximum number of rows to read. The resulting sample will always
     contain exactly that many rows, unless the table does not contain
     enough rows, in which case the whole table is selected.
  
     Like the built-in SYSTEM sampling method, SYSTEM_ROWS performs
     block-level sampling, so that the sample is not completely random but
     may be subject to clustering effects, especially if only a small number
     of rows are requested.
  
     SYSTEM_ROWS does not support the REPEATABLE clause.
  
     This module is considered "trusted", that is, it can be installed by
     non-superusers who have CREATE privilege on the current database.
  
  F.46.1. Examples
  
     Here is an example of selecting a sample of a table with SYSTEM_ROWS.
     First install the extension:
  CREATE EXTENSION tsm_system_rows;
  
     Then you can use it in a SELECT command, for instance:
  SELECT * FROM my_table TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM_ROWS(100);
  
     This command will return a sample of 100 rows from the table my_table
     (unless the table does not have 100 visible rows, in which case all its
     rows are returned).
