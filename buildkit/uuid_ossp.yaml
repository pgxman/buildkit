           [10]F.49.3. Author

           The uuid-ossp module provides functions to generate universally unique
           identifiers (UUIDs) using one of several standard algorithms. There are
           also functions to produce certain special UUID constants. This module
           is only necessary for special requirements beyond what is available in
           core PostgreSQL. See [11]Section 9.14 for built-in ways to generate
           UUIDs.

           This module is considered "trusted", that is, it can be installed by
           non-superusers who have CREATE privilege on the current database.

        F.49.1. uuid-ossp Functions [12]#

           [13]Table F.34 shows the functions available to generate UUIDs. The
           relevant standards ITU-T Rec. X.667, ISO/IEC 9834-8:2005, and [14]RFC
           4122 specify four algorithms for generating UUIDs, identified by the
           version numbers 1, 3, 4, and 5. (There is no version 2 algorithm.) Each
           of these algorithms could be suitable for a different set of
           applications.

           Table F.34. Functions for UUID Generation

           Function

           Description

           uuid_generate_v1 () -> uuid

           Generates a version 1 UUID. This involves the MAC address of the
           computer and a time stamp. Note that UUIDs of this kind reveal the
           identity of the computer that created the identifier and the time at
           which it did so, which might make it unsuitable for certain
           security-sensitive applications.

           uuid_generate_v1mc () -> uuid

           Generates a version 1 UUID, but uses a random multicast MAC address
           instead of the real MAC address of the computer.

           uuid_generate_v3 ( namespace uuid, name text ) -> uuid

           Generates a version 3 UUID in the given namespace using the specified
           input name. The namespace should be one of the special constants
           produced by the uuid_ns_*() functions shown in [15]Table F.35. (It
           could be any UUID in theory.) The name is an identifier in the selected
           namespace.

           For example:
        SELECT uuid_generate_v3(uuid_ns_url(), 'http://www.postgresql.org');

           The name parameter will be MD5-hashed, so the cleartext cannot be
           derived from the generated UUID. The generation of UUIDs by this method
           has no random or environment-dependent element and is therefore
           reproducible.

           uuid_generate_v4 () -> uuid

           Generates a version 4 UUID, which is derived entirely from random
           numbers.

           uuid_generate_v5 ( namespace uuid, name text ) -> uuid

           Generates a version 5 UUID, which works like a version 3 UUID except
           that SHA-1 is used as a hashing method. Version 5 should be preferred
           over version 3 because SHA-1 is thought to be more secure than MD5.

           Table F.35. Functions Returning UUID Constants

           Function

           Description

           uuid_nil () -> uuid

           Returns a "nil" UUID constant, which does not occur as a real UUID.

           uuid_ns_dns () -> uuid

           Returns a constant designating the DNS namespace for UUIDs.

           uuid_ns_url () -> uuid

           Returns a constant designating the URL namespace for UUIDs.

           uuid_ns_oid () -> uuid

           Returns a constant designating the ISO object identifier (OID)
           namespace for UUIDs. (This pertains to ASN.1 OIDs, which are unrelated
           to the OIDs used in PostgreSQL.)

           uuid_ns_x500 () -> uuid

           Returns a constant designating the X.500 distinguished name (DN)
           namespace for UUIDs.

        F.49.2. Building uuid-ossp [16]#

           Historically this module depended on the OSSP UUID library, which
           accounts for the module's name. While the OSSP UUID library can still
           be found at [17]http://www.ossp.org/pkg/lib/uuid/, it is not well
           maintained, and is becoming increasingly difficult to port to newer
           platforms. uuid-ossp can now be built without the OSSP library on some
           platforms. On FreeBSD and some other BSD-derived platforms, suitable
           UUID creation functions are included in the core libc library. On
           Linux, macOS, and some other platforms, suitable functions are provided
           in the libuuid library, which originally came from the e2fsprogs
           project (though on modern Linux it is considered part of
           util-linux-ng). When invoking configure, specify --with-uuid=bsd to use
           the BSD functions, or --with-uuid=e2fs to use e2fsprogs' libuuid, or
           --with-uuid=ossp to use the OSSP UUID library. More than one of these
           libraries might be available on a particular machine, so configure does
           not automatically choose one.

           numbers 1, 3, 4, and 5. (There is no version 2 algorithm.) Each of
           these algorithms could be suitable for a different set of applications.

           Table F.32. Functions for UUID Generation

           Function

           Description

           uuid_generate_v1 () -> uuid

           Generates a version 1 UUID. This involves the MAC address of the
           computer and a time stamp. Note that UUIDs of this kind reveal the
           identity of the computer that created the identifier and the time at
           which it did so, which might make it unsuitable for certain
           security-sensitive applications.

           uuid_generate_v1mc () -> uuid

           Generates a version 1 UUID, but uses a random multicast MAC address
           instead of the real MAC address of the computer.

           uuid_generate_v3 ( namespace uuid, name text ) -> uuid

           Generates a version 3 UUID in the given namespace using the specified
           input name. The namespace should be one of the special constants
           produced by the uuid_ns_*() functions shown in [12]Table F.33. (It
           could be any UUID in theory.) The name is an identifier in the selected
           namespace.

           For example:
        SELECT uuid_generate_v3(uuid_ns_url(), 'http://www.postgresql.org');

           The name parameter will be MD5-hashed, so the cleartext cannot be
           derived from the generated UUID. The generation of UUIDs by this method
           has no random or environment-dependent element and is therefore
           reproducible.

           uuid_generate_v4 () -> uuid

           Generates a version 4 UUID, which is derived entirely from random
           numbers.

           uuid_generate_v5 ( namespace uuid, name text ) -> uuid

           Generates a version 5 UUID, which works like a version 3 UUID except
           that SHA-1 is used as a hashing method. Version 5 should be preferred
           over version 3 because SHA-1 is thought to be more secure than MD5.

           Table F.33. Functions Returning UUID Constants

           Function

           Description

           uuid_nil () -> uuid

           Returns a "nil" UUID constant, which does not occur as a real UUID.

           uuid_ns_dns () -> uuid

           Returns a constant designating the DNS namespace for UUIDs.

           uuid_ns_url () -> uuid

           Returns a constant designating the URL namespace for UUIDs.

           uuid_ns_oid () -> uuid

           Returns a constant designating the ISO object identifier (OID)
           namespace for UUIDs. (This pertains to ASN.1 OIDs, which are unrelated
           to the OIDs used in PostgreSQL.)

           uuid_ns_x500 () -> uuid

           Returns a constant designating the X.500 distinguished name (DN)
           namespace for UUIDs.

        F.44.2. Building uuid-ossp

           Historically this module depended on the OSSP UUID library, which
           accounts for the module's name. While the OSSP UUID library can still
           be found at [13]http://www.ossp.org/pkg/lib/uuid/, it is not well
           maintained, and is becoming increasingly difficult to port to newer
           platforms. uuid-ossp can now be built without the OSSP library on some
           platforms. On FreeBSD and some other BSD-derived platforms, suitable
           UUID creation functions are included in the core libc library. On
           Linux, macOS, and some other platforms, suitable functions are provided
           in the libuuid library, which originally came from the e2fsprogs
           project (though on modern Linux it is considered part of
           util-linux-ng). When invoking configure, specify --with-uuid=bsd to use
           the BSD functions, or --with-uuid=e2fs to use e2fsprogs' libuuid, or
           --with-uuid=ossp to use the OSSP UUID library. More than one of these
           libraries might be available on a particular machine, so configure does
           not automatically choose one.
