     The uuid-ossp module provides functions to generate universally unique
     identifiers (UUIDs) using one of several standard algorithms. There are
     also functions to produce certain special UUID constants. This module
     is only necessary for special requirements beyond what is available in
     core PostgreSQL. See Section 9.14 for built-in ways to generate
     UUIDs.
  
     This module is considered "trusted", that is, it can be installed by
     non-superusers who have CREATE privilege on the current database.
  
  F.49.1. uuid-ossp Functions
  
     Table F.32 shows the functions available to generate UUIDs. The
     relevant standards ITU-T Rec. X.667, ISO/IEC 9834-8:2005, and RFC
     4122 specify four algorithms for generating UUIDs, identified by the
     version numbers 1, 3, 4, and 5. (There is no version 2 algorithm.) Each
     of these algorithms could be suitable for a different set of
     applications.
  
     Table F.32. Functions for UUID Generation
  
     Function
  
     Description
  
     uuid_generate_v1 () -> uuid
  
     Generates a version 1 UUID. This involves the MAC address of the
     computer and a time stamp. Note that UUIDs of this kind reveal the
     identity of the computer that created the identifier and the time at
     which it did so, which might make it unsuitable for certain
     security-sensitive applications.
  
     uuid_generate_v1mc () -> uuid
  
     Generates a version 1 UUID, but uses a random multicast MAC address
     instead of the real MAC address of the computer.
  
     uuid_generate_v3 ( namespace uuid, name text ) -> uuid
  
     Generates a version 3 UUID in the given namespace using the specified
     input name. The namespace should be one of the special constants
     produced by the uuid_ns_*() functions shown in Table F.33. (It
     could be any UUID in theory.) The name is an identifier in the selected
     namespace.
  
     For example:
  SELECT uuid_generate_v3(uuid_ns_url(), 'http://www.postgresql.org');
  
     The name parameter will be MD5-hashed, so the cleartext cannot be
     derived from the generated UUID. The generation of UUIDs by this method
     has no random or environment-dependent element and is therefore
     reproducible.
  
     uuid_generate_v4 () -> uuid
  
     Generates a version 4 UUID, which is derived entirely from random
     numbers.
  
     uuid_generate_v5 ( namespace uuid, name text ) -> uuid
  
     Generates a version 5 UUID, which works like a version 3 UUID except
     that SHA-1 is used as a hashing method. Version 5 should be preferred
     over version 3 because SHA-1 is thought to be more secure than MD5.
  
     Table F.33. Functions Returning UUID Constants
  
     Function
  
     Description
  
     uuid_nil () -> uuid
  
     Returns a "nil" UUID constant, which does not occur as a real UUID.
  
     uuid_ns_dns () -> uuid
  
     Returns a constant designating the DNS namespace for UUIDs.
  
     uuid_ns_url () -> uuid
  
     Returns a constant designating the URL namespace for UUIDs.
  
     uuid_ns_oid () -> uuid
  
     Returns a constant designating the ISO object identifier (OID)
     namespace for UUIDs. (This pertains to ASN.1 OIDs, which are unrelated
     to the OIDs used in PostgreSQL.)
  
     uuid_ns_x500 () -> uuid
  
     Returns a constant designating the X.500 distinguished name (DN)
     namespace for UUIDs.
  
  F.49.2. Building uuid-ossp
  
     Historically this module depended on the OSSP UUID library, which
     accounts for the module's name. While the OSSP UUID library can still
     be found at http://www.ossp.org/pkg/lib/uuid/, it is not well
     maintained, and is becoming increasingly difficult to port to newer
     platforms. uuid-ossp can now be built without the OSSP library on some
     platforms. On FreeBSD and some other BSD-derived platforms, suitable
     UUID creation functions are included in the core libc library. On
     Linux, macOS, and some other platforms, suitable functions are provided
     in the libuuid library, which originally came from the e2fsprogs
     project (though on modern Linux it is considered part of
     util-linux-ng). When invoking configure, specify --with-uuid=bsd to use
     the BSD functions, or --with-uuid=e2fs to use e2fsprogs' libuuid, or
     --with-uuid=ossp to use the OSSP UUID library. More than one of these
     libraries might be available on a particular machine, so configure does
     not automatically choose one.
