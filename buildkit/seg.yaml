           This module implements a data type seg for representing line segments,
           or floating point intervals. seg can represent uncertainty in the
           interval endpoints, making it especially useful for representing
           laboratory measurements.

           This module is considered "trusted", that is, it can be installed by
           non-superusers who have CREATE privilege on the current database.

        F.39.1. Rationale [14]#

           The geometry of measurements is usually more complex than that of a
           point in a numeric continuum. A measurement is usually a segment of
           that continuum with somewhat fuzzy limits. The measurements come out as
           intervals because of uncertainty and randomness, as well as because the
           value being measured may naturally be an interval indicating some
           condition, such as the temperature range of stability of a protein.

           Using just common sense, it appears more convenient to store such data
           as intervals, rather than pairs of numbers. In practice, it even turns
           out more efficient in most applications.

           Further along the line of common sense, the fuzziness of the limits
           suggests that the use of traditional numeric data types leads to a
           certain loss of information. Consider this: your instrument reads 6.50,
           and you input this reading into the database. What do you get when you
           fetch it? Watch:
        test=> select 6.50 :: float8 as "pH";
         pH
        ---
        6.5
        (1 row)

           In the world of measurements, 6.50 is not the same as 6.5. It may
           sometimes be critically different. The experimenters usually write down
           (and publish) the digits they trust. 6.50 is actually a fuzzy interval
           contained within a bigger and even fuzzier interval, 6.5, with their
           center points being (probably) the only common feature they share. We
           definitely do not want such different data items to appear the same.

           Conclusion? It is nice to have a special data type that can record the
           limits of an interval with arbitrarily variable precision. Variable in
           the sense that each data element records its own precision.

           Check this out:
        test=> select '6.25 .. 6.50'::seg as "pH";
                  pH
        ------------
        6.25 .. 6.50
        (1 row)

        F.39.2. Syntax [15]#

           The external representation of an interval is formed using one or two
           floating-point numbers joined by the range operator (.. or ...).
           Alternatively, it can be specified as a center point plus or minus a
           deviation. Optional certainty indicators (<, > or ~) can be stored as
           well. (Certainty indicators are ignored by all the built-in operators,
           however.) [16]Table F.28 gives an overview of allowed representations;
           [17]Table F.29 shows some examples.

           In [18]Table F.28, x, y, and delta denote floating-point numbers. x and
           y, but not delta, can be preceded by a certainty indicator.

           Table F.28. seg External Representations
           x            Single value (zero-length interval)
           x .. y       Interval from x to y
           x (+-) delta Interval from x - delta to x + delta
           x ..         Open interval with lower bound x
           .. x         Open interval with upper bound x

           Table F.29. Examples of Valid seg Input
           5.0 Creates a zero-length segment (a point, if you will)
           ~5.0 Creates a zero-length segment and records ~ in the data. ~ is
           ignored by seg operations, but is preserved as a comment.
           <5.0 Creates a point at 5.0. < is ignored but is preserved as a
           comment.
           >5.0 Creates a point at 5.0. > is ignored but is preserved as a
           comment.
           5(+-)0.3 Creates an interval 4.7 .. 5.3. Note that the (+-) notation
           isn't preserved.
           50 .. Everything that is greater than or equal to 50
           .. 0 Everything that is less than or equal to 0
           1.5e-2 .. 2E-2 Creates an interval 0.015 .. 0.02
           1 ... 2 The same as 1...2, or 1 .. 2, or 1..2 (spaces around the range
           operator are ignored)

           Because the ... operator is widely used in data sources, it is allowed
           as an alternative spelling of the .. operator. Unfortunately, this
           creates a parsing ambiguity: it is not clear whether the upper bound in
           0...23 is meant to be 23 or 0.23. This is resolved by requiring at
           least one digit before the decimal point in all numbers in seg input.

           As a sanity check, seg rejects intervals with the lower bound greater
           than the upper, for example 5 .. 2.

        F.39.3. Precision [19]#

           seg values are stored internally as pairs of 32-bit floating point
           numbers. This means that numbers with more than 7 significant digits
           will be truncated.

           Numbers with 7 or fewer significant digits retain their original
           precision. That is, if your query returns 0.00, you will be sure that
           the trailing zeroes are not the artifacts of formatting: they reflect
           the precision of the original data. The number of leading zeroes does
           not affect precision: the value 0.0067 is considered to have just 2
           significant digits.

        F.39.4. Usage [20]#

           The seg module includes a GiST index operator class for seg values. The
           operators supported by the GiST operator class are shown in
           [21]Table F.30.

           Table F.30. Seg GiST Operators

           Operator

           Description

           seg << seg -> boolean

           Is the first seg entirely to the left of the second? [a, b] << [c, d]
           is true if b < c.

           seg >> seg -> boolean

           Is the first seg entirely to the right of the second? [a, b] >> [c, d]
           is true if a > d.

           seg &< seg -> boolean

           Does the first seg not extend to the right of the second? [a, b] &< [c,
           d] is true if b <= d.

           seg &> seg -> boolean

           Does the first seg not extend to the left of the second? [a, b] &> [c,
           d] is true if a >= c.

           seg = seg -> boolean

           Are the two segs equal?

           seg && seg -> boolean

           Do the two segs overlap?

           seg @> seg -> boolean

           Does the first seg contain the second?

           seg <@ seg -> boolean

           Is the first seg contained in the second?

           In addition to the above operators, the usual comparison operators
           shown in [22]Table 9.1 are available for type seg. These operators
           first compare (a) to (c), and if these are equal, compare (b) to (d).
           That results in reasonably good sorting in most cases, which is useful
           if you want to use ORDER BY with this type.

        F.39.5. Notes [23]#

           For examples of usage, see the regression test sql/seg.sql.

           The mechanism that converts (+-) to regular ranges isn't completely
           accurate in determining the number of significant digits for the
           boundaries. For example, it adds an extra digit to the lower boundary
           if the resulting interval includes a power of ten:
        postgres=> select '10(+-)1'::seg as seg;
              seg
        ---------
        9.0 .. 11             -- should be: 9 .. 11

           The performance of an R-tree index can largely depend on the initial
           order of input values. It may be very helpful to sort the input table
           on the seg column; see the script sort-segments.pl for an example.

           This module implements a data type seg for representing line segments,
           or floating point intervals. seg can represent uncertainty in the
           interval endpoints, making it especially useful for representing
           laboratory measurements.

           This module is considered "trusted", that is, it can be installed by
           non-superusers who have CREATE privilege on the current database.

        F.36.1. Rationale

           The geometry of measurements is usually more complex than that of a
           point in a numeric continuum. A measurement is usually a segment of
           that continuum with somewhat fuzzy limits. The measurements come out as
           intervals because of uncertainty and randomness, as well as because the
           value being measured may naturally be an interval indicating some
           condition, such as the temperature range of stability of a protein.

           Using just common sense, it appears more convenient to store such data
           as intervals, rather than pairs of numbers. In practice, it even turns
           out more efficient in most applications.

           Further along the line of common sense, the fuzziness of the limits
           suggests that the use of traditional numeric data types leads to a
           certain loss of information. Consider this: your instrument reads 6.50,
           and you input this reading into the database. What do you get when you
           fetch it? Watch:
        test=> select 6.50 :: float8 as "pH";
         pH
        ---
        6.5
        (1 row)

           In the world of measurements, 6.50 is not the same as 6.5. It may
           sometimes be critically different. The experimenters usually write down
           (and publish) the digits they trust. 6.50 is actually a fuzzy interval
           contained within a bigger and even fuzzier interval, 6.5, with their
           center points being (probably) the only common feature they share. We
           definitely do not want such different data items to appear the same.

           Conclusion? It is nice to have a special data type that can record the
           limits of an interval with arbitrarily variable precision. Variable in
           the sense that each data element records its own precision.

           Check this out:
        test=> select '6.25 .. 6.50'::seg as "pH";
                  pH
        ------------
        6.25 .. 6.50
        (1 row)

        F.36.2. Syntax

           The external representation of an interval is formed using one or two
           floating-point numbers joined by the range operator (.. or ...).
           Alternatively, it can be specified as a center point plus or minus a
           deviation. Optional certainty indicators (<, > or ~) can be stored as
           well. (Certainty indicators are ignored by all the built-in operators,
           however.) [13]Table F.27 gives an overview of allowed representations;
           [14]Table F.28 shows some examples.

           In [15]Table F.27, x, y, and delta denote floating-point numbers. x and
           y, but not delta, can be preceded by a certainty indicator.

           Table F.27. seg External Representations
           x            Single value (zero-length interval)
           x .. y       Interval from x to y
           x (+-) delta Interval from x - delta to x + delta
           x ..         Open interval with lower bound x
           .. x         Open interval with upper bound x

           Table F.28. Examples of Valid seg Input
           5.0 Creates a zero-length segment (a point, if you will)
           ~5.0 Creates a zero-length segment and records ~ in the data. ~ is
           ignored by seg operations, but is preserved as a comment.
           <5.0 Creates a point at 5.0. < is ignored but is preserved as a
           comment.
           >5.0 Creates a point at 5.0. > is ignored but is preserved as a
           comment.
           5(+-)0.3 Creates an interval 4.7 .. 5.3. Note that the (+-) notation
           isn't preserved.
           50 .. Everything that is greater than or equal to 50
           .. 0 Everything that is less than or equal to 0
           1.5e-2 .. 2E-2 Creates an interval 0.015 .. 0.02
           1 ... 2 The same as 1...2, or 1 .. 2, or 1..2 (spaces around the range
           operator are ignored)

           Because the ... operator is widely used in data sources, it is allowed
           as an alternative spelling of the .. operator. Unfortunately, this
           creates a parsing ambiguity: it is not clear whether the upper bound in
           0...23 is meant to be 23 or 0.23. This is resolved by requiring at
           least one digit before the decimal point in all numbers in seg input.

           As a sanity check, seg rejects intervals with the lower bound greater
           than the upper, for example 5 .. 2.

        F.36.3. Precision

           seg values are stored internally as pairs of 32-bit floating point
           numbers. This means that numbers with more than 7 significant digits
           will be truncated.

           Numbers with 7 or fewer significant digits retain their original
           precision. That is, if your query returns 0.00, you will be sure that
           the trailing zeroes are not the artifacts of formatting: they reflect
           the precision of the original data. The number of leading zeroes does
           not affect precision: the value 0.0067 is considered to have just 2
           significant digits.

        F.36.4. Usage

           The seg module includes a GiST index operator class for seg values. The
           operators supported by the GiST operator class are shown in
           [16]Table F.29.

           Table F.29. Seg GiST Operators

           Operator

           Description

           seg << seg -> boolean

           Is the first seg entirely to the left of the second? [a, b] << [c, d]
           is true if b < c.

           seg >> seg -> boolean

           Is the first seg entirely to the right of the second? [a, b] >> [c, d]
           is true if a > d.

           seg &< seg -> boolean

           Does the first seg not extend to the right of the second? [a, b] &< [c,
           d] is true if b <= d.

           seg &> seg -> boolean

           Does the first seg not extend to the left of the second? [a, b] &> [c,
           d] is true if a >= c.

           seg = seg -> boolean

           Are the two segs equal?

           seg && seg -> boolean

           Do the two segs overlap?

           seg @> seg -> boolean

           Does the first seg contain the second?

           seg <@ seg -> boolean

           Is the first seg contained in the second?

           In addition to the above operators, the usual comparison operators
           shown in [17]Table 9.1 are available for type seg. These operators
           first compare (a) to (c), and if these are equal, compare (b) to (d).
           That results in reasonably good sorting in most cases, which is useful
           if you want to use ORDER BY with this type.

        F.36.5. Notes

           For examples of usage, see the regression test sql/seg.sql.

           The mechanism that converts (+-) to regular ranges isn't completely
           accurate in determining the number of significant digits for the
           boundaries. For example, it adds an extra digit to the lower boundary
           if the resulting interval includes a power of ten:
        postgres=> select '10(+-)1'::seg as seg;
              seg
        ---------
        9.0 .. 11             -- should be: 9 .. 11

           The performance of an R-tree index can largely depend on the initial
           order of input values. It may be very helpful to sort the input table
           on the seg column; see the script sort-segments.pl for an example.
