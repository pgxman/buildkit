        F.44. tcn -- a trigger function to notify listeners of changes to table
        content [7]#

           The tcn module provides a trigger function that notifies listeners of
           changes to any table on which it is attached. It must be used as an
           AFTER trigger FOR EACH ROW.

           This module is considered "trusted", that is, it can be installed by
           non-superusers who have CREATE privilege on the current database.

           Only one parameter may be supplied to the function in a CREATE TRIGGER
           statement, and that is optional. If supplied it will be used for the
           channel name for the notifications. If omitted tcn will be used for the
           channel name.

           The payload of the notifications consists of the table name, a letter
           to indicate which type of operation was performed, and column
           name/value pairs for primary key columns. Each part is separated from
           the next by a comma. For ease of parsing using regular expressions,
           table and column names are always wrapped in double quotes, and data
           values are always wrapped in single quotes. Embedded quotes are
           doubled.

           A brief example of using the extension follows.

        test-#   (
